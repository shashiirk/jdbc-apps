# Subscribe App
Usually many blog sites prompt the users to subscribe to their weekly newsletters by asking them to provide their email addresses.
This application is like a clone to such subscribe prompts.

Users have to provide their email address to subscribe. Email is subscribed only if it is valid. When the email is subscribed, then it is stored in the database along with the date and time it is subscribed at. Database also ensures that all emails in it are unique by restricting the already subscribed email to subscribe again.
